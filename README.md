<h3>Partial Problem Description</h3>

The problem can be formulated as a graph problem as follows: Given an undirected weighted graph, a starting vertex, and a set of destination vertices, find a subgraph of the graph that has the minimum cost and covers the starting vertex and all of the destination vertices. 

For example, for graph (a) shown below, assume the starting vertex is 1, and the set of destination vertices is {5,6}, then graph (b) shows a minimum covering tree.
